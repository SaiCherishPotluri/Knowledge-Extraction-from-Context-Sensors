Collaborated with a team of five in conceiving and designing an android mobile application that recorded videos and extracted information from them using knowledge recovery algorithm.
Developed and automated the process of capturing a video, uploading it to the Node.js server and extracting it frame by frame, thus increasing applicationâ€™s speed.
Predicted the gestures accurately and at a higher pace using the cosine similarity algorithm over a database of DeafTec gesture videos.
